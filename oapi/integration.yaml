            Specifies the jurisdiction under which this game is
            being played. The game will enforce specific
            jurisdiction requirements based on this parameter.
            For example: use “GB” to conform with UKGC
            requirements.
            If not provided, no specific jurisdiction requirements are
            applied.

          description: |
            Specifies the time interval in seconds at which the
            reality check will appear on the screen. A zero value
            indicates no time interval which means that the reality
            check will never be presented (or presented just once if
            realityCheckStartTime is provided).
            Mandatory in case jurisdiction parameters are set to one
            which requires reality checks.
            If the specified jurisdiction does not require reality
            checks, or is not provided, but this parameter is
            provided, an error will be returned.

          description: |
            Indicates the seconds to wait until the 1st reality check
            should be presented. A zero value means that the reality
            check should be presented immediately w/o delay.
            If you don’t want to present a reality check at all, just
            set realityCheckInterval to zero, and don’t set
            realityCheckStartTime at all.
            This parameter provides a way to seamlessly continue
            previous reality checks presented during the player’s
            game session.
            If not provided, realityCheckInterval is used instead.
